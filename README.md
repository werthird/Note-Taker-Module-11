Here is a very handy note taking web app. If you want to keep track of anything you need to be doing, from grocery lists, to errands to run, this will display each item in an organized and easy to use way. Just enter your note into the app, click save, and it will dispaly for as long as you need it. We also added in a real handy feature to delete the note when you no longer need it.
